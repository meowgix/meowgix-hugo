## Day #3

> Today was okay. Could be better.

### ðŸŒ± Real Life

***

#### Professional Development

* **Study:**  At this point I am definitely procrastinating from fear/test anxiety which is unusual for me... D204 Exam

        Hours today: 0h
        Hours total: 0h
* **Code:**  Watched a few videos to solidify my understanding of Hugo. Didn't bother much with `.scss` work.
* **Work:**  N/A

#### Personal Development

* **Piano:**  Played all the book songs in my songs list.
* **Art:**  N/A
* **Health:**  Logged my meals for the day and took a walk around noon. That was different for me.

### ðŸ‘½ Virtual Life

***

* **Games:**  Still no capacity for gaming right now.
* **K-Variety:**  Watched the new Friends episode and went back to watch first two episodes of Heart Signal 2.

#### Next Steps

> Tomorrow I want to _actually_ spend time studying for my upcoming exam (rescheduled - again). I also hope to balance my time better and limit my social media use.
