## Beginning Again - Blog #2.1

> There is something poetic about reading the last blog I posted, over 9 months ago. I wrote down that it was difficult getting this off the ground, and just like that - POOF. I disappeared.
>
> I wish to return and try this again. It would be a great help in getting my feet off the ground and making more progress, if I could actually track the changes as they are happening.

### ðŸ‘½ Virtual Life

***

* **Games:**  Played the Sims 4 a little bit. Lacking motivation and imagination.
* **K-Variety/K-Drama:**  Currently watching "Mama The Idol" Episode 4. I find it inspiring but also a little hard to watch for some reason. A lot of shows are on hiatus for the Winter Olympics... I may try to squeeze in "Rookie Cops" Episode 5 and 6 today as well.

#### Next Steps

> Show myself love, kindness, and gratitude.
