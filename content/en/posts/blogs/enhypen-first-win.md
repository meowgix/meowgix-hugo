## Day #4

> Today was okay. Could be better.

### ðŸŒ± Real Life

***

#### Professional Development

* **Study:**  D204 Exam

        Hours today: 0h
        Hours total: 0h
* **Code:**  N/A
* **Work:**  N/A

#### Personal Development

* **Piano:**  Played all the book songs in my songs list and worked on beginning of one new song.
* **Art:**  N/A
* **Health:**  Went for a walk in the morning. Logged meals but did not stick to calorie budget.

### ðŸ‘½ Virtual Life

***

* **Games:**  Still no capacity for gaming right now.
* **K-Variety:**  Continue watching Heart Signal 2, but maybe that's a bad decision?

#### Next Steps

> Tomorrow I want to _actually_ spend time studying for my upcoming exam (rescheduled - again). I also hope to balance my time better and limit my social media use.
