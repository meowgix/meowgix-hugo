## Day #2

> This is the second blog. I'm still figuring many things out, but as I get it together, I also get side-tracked. Oops.

### ðŸŒ± Real Life

***

#### Professional Development

* **Study:**  D204 Exam

        Hours today: 0h
        Hours total: 0h

* **Code:**  Successfully got the first post to show up on the website. Also working on breaking down the theme `.scss` files in order to edit them.
* **Work:**  N/A

#### Personal Development

* **Piano:**  Played a few songs for the first time in a while. It was nice.
* **Art:**  Finished reading "Lesson 0" from [Draw A Box.](https:\\drawabox.com)
* **Health:**  Logged my meals for the day and took a short walk. Didn't meet my step goal though.

### ðŸ‘½ Virtual Life

***

* **Games:**  Still no capacity for gaming right now.

#### Next Steps

> Tomorrow I want to _actually_ spend time studying for my upcoming exam (rescheduled). I also hope to balance my time better, limit my social media use, and watch the new episode of Friends (Korean Heart Signal spinoff).
