Day #2

This is the second blog. I'm still figuring many things out, but as I get it together, I also get side-tracked. Oops.

Real Life

***

Professional Development

Study Log:

    Hours today: 0h
    Hours total: 0h

Code:  Successfully got the first post to show up on the website. Also working on breaking down the theme `.scss` files in order to edit them.

Work:

Personal Development

Piano:  Played a few songs for the first time in a while. It was nice.

Drawing:  Finished reading "Lesson 0" from [drawabox](https:\\drawabox.com)

Health:  Logged my meals for the day and took a short walk. Didn't meet my step goal though.

Virtual Life

***

Games:  Still no capacity for gaming right now.

Next Steps

Tomorrow I want to *actually* spend time studying for my upcoming exam (rescheduled). I also hope to balance my time better, limit my social media use, and watch the new episode of Friends (Korean Heart Signal spinoff).
