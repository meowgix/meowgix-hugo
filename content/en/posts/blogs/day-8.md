## Day #8

> I can admit that keeping this blog has been just about as challenging as I expected it to be. I'm still not totally satisfied with the layout. I also just have a hard time making a routine for myself and sticking to it.

### ðŸŒ± Real Life

        Hours today: 0h
        Hours total: 0h
* **Code:**  My goal is to finish the orientation part of LS today.
* **Work:**  N/A

#### Personal Development

* **Piano:**  I want to play all of my book songs today.

* **Health:**  Go for a walk and give your stomach a rest.

### ðŸ‘½ Virtual Life

***

* **Games:**  N/A
* **K-Variety/K-Drama:**  There should be a new episode of Mouse. I'm trying to get into "Mine" because I love the main lead actresses. We'll see.

#### Next Steps

> My next steps are to get back on the wagon. Tidy up. Make a schedule.
